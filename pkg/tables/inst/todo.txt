To-do list

Change storage to allow matrices of things to be displayed, all
using the same conventions:  main table in the middle, row and column labels to the left and top respectively, plus new matrix in 
top left --- or even larger matrices to allow labels on all sides.

Bug in Paste:  the title is wrong in

lq <- function(x) quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
uq <- function(x) quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)

Iqr2 <- function(digits, head="IQR") {
  Paste(lq, uq, digits = digits, head = head, sep=",", prefix="[", postfix="]")
}
